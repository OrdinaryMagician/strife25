# Strife 25th Anniversary Project
## Coming 2021

Right now there's nothing here, we haven't started yet.

### What even is this thing

When it comes to id tech 1 titles, Strife gets very little attention from the
modding community, which is a shame, because it's a pretty solid game.

Since the 25th anniversary of the game's release is coming in a couple years,
I had the idea to celebrate by releasing a big map pack for it.

The Strife 25th Anniversary Project is part of the "Lords of Terror" trilogy,
along with Spooktober and HeXmas (20 Heretics and Soundless Mound also play
some part into this continuity, though).

### What's set for now

It will be a hub, definitely. A single player campaign, set 25 years after the
ending of the original game. Long after the fall of the Order, there's news of
a hostile force coming from beyond the seas. As an elite soldier of the Front,
it is your mission to combat this new threat.
